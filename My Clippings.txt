La guerra es el arte del engaño.9 Por lo tanto, si eres capaz, finge incapacidad. Si estás preparado, finge no estarlo. Si estás cerca, finge estar lejos. Si estás lejos, finge estar cerca. Tienta al enemigo con cebos, aparenta desorden y golpéalo. Si el enemigo es consistente, prepárate. Si es fuerte, evítalo. Si es iracundo, provócalo. Si es orgulloso, muestra humildad. Si está descansado, fatígalo. Si está unido, divídelo. Atácalo cuando no lo espere. Aparece de manera imprevista.10 Estas estratagemas aseguran la victoria, pero no pueden divulgarse.

Baudrillard señala la peculiaridad arquitectónica de las Torres Gemelas, que ya en 1993 fueron el objetivo de atentados terroristas islámicos. Mientras que los rascacielos del Rockefeller Center reflejan la ciudad y el cielo sobre sus fachadas de vidrio y acero, las Torres Gemelas no implicaban ninguna referencia externa, ninguna relación con lo otro. Los dos edificios gemelos, iguales entre sí y que se reflejan mutuamente, constituyen un sistema cerrado en sí mismo. Imponen lo igual, excluyendo por completo lo distinto. El atentado terrorista abrió brechas en este sistema global de lo igual.

You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.

the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It’s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them—or the world, which is their primary concern? And if they haven’t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace.

When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger.

In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?

Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer. Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present—and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can’t hold out against that … well, then, heap shame upon it.

You’ll remember that the Challenger rep is the rep who loves to debate. The one who uses his or her deep understanding of a customer’s business not simply to serve them, but to teach them: to push their thinking and provide them with new and different ways to think about their business and how to compete.

A Challenger is really defined by the ability to do three things: teach, tailor, and take control: With their unique perspective on the customer’s business and their ability to engage in robust two-way dialogue, Challengers are able to teach for differentiation during the sales interaction. Because Challengers possess a superior sense of a customer’s economic and value drivers, they are able to tailor for resonance, delivering the right message to the right person within the customer organization.

Because Challengers possess a superior sense of a customer’s economic and value drivers, they are able to tailor for resonance, delivering the right message to the right person within the customer organization.

Teaching is all about offering customers unique perspectives on their business and communicating those perspectives with passion and precision in a way that draws the customer into the conversation. These new perspectives apply not to your products and solutions, but to how the customer can compete more effectively in their market. It’s insight they can use to free up operating expenses, penetrate new markets, or reduce risk.

“When the topic of price comes up, a powerful technique is for the sales professional to shift the discussion from price to value. The value of the current offering is a great place to start this dialogue. During the course of such a discussion, it is useful to get the customer to rank the elements of the offering in order of importance. This sometimes enables the customer to see the offering in a different light; these new insights are very useful to both the sales professional and the customer as they think about value.”

That’s why Challengers can be so hard to find. As human beings, our natural inclination is to seek closure, not postpone it, to reduce tension, not increase it. For sales reps, this translates into a tendency to agree with the customer, not present a different—and potentially unsettling—point of view. Yet Challenger reps have learned to do just that.

While it doesn’t have to be verbatim, reps are encouraged to say something like, “I understand that price is something we need to address, but before we do, I’d like to take a moment to make sure I completely understand your needs—so we can make sure we’re doing everything we can to make this deal as valuable as possible for you.

Decades of research into human behavior has uncovered a number of human biases that commonly hinder opening thinking. The six most common are: Practicality bias: Ideas that seem unrealistic should be discarded. Confirmation bias: Unexplainable customer behaviors can be ignored. Exportability bias: If it didn’t work here, it won’t work anywhere. Legacy bias: The way we’ve always done it must be best. First conclusion bias: The first explanation offered is usually the best or only choice. Personal bias: If I wouldn’t buy it, the customer won’t either.

An interviewer can probe for this by asking questions like, “How do you usually open a sales conversation with a customer?” or “Can you describe a time when you got a customer to think of their problem or need differently?” The interviewee’s pitches should highlight customer benefits before supplier strengths and, ideally, offer unique insights that prompt the customer to think differently about their world.

But there are several ways to be “customer-centric” that are actually bad for business. Two examples of this that we hear frequently from our members are (1) discounts and other terms and conditions that undermine profitability in exchange for little long-term gain, and (2) assuming an order-taker posture with the customer (i.e., taking short-term orders when the customer is pushing for them, instead of getting them to think about longer-term business).

And to do that, remember these two things: First, be memorable, not agreeable.

First, controllable unlimited leverage means your entrepreneurial venture has leverage through scaling probability. This means your income has either a high ceiling, or none at all. You could be making $4,000 monthly and by next year, it could grow to $40,000 monthly.

Bullshit 1.0 is crutches: the stinking pile of excuses and manufactured fairy tales we tell ourselves. These scapegoats justify do-nothingness. Other times, they explain away failures or circumstances. And as long as we clutch these convenient fantasies, change adversity and righteousness bribe us into buying our victimhood. Bullshit 2.0 is clichés: a bunch of meaningless mantras and proverbs revered as gospel; pithy slogans, sweet and soothing, reassuring, and unfortunately, invitations for more do-nothingness. And Bullshit 3.0 is cults and their leaders: gurus and slithery figureheads who will fill your head with whatever you want it filled with.

Changing your head means throwing on your Perry Mason hat, whipping out the Marlboros, and putting your brain in the interrogation chair. TECHNIQUE #2: THE CANCER COROLLARY C-A-N-C-E-R. Cancer. Quite possibly the most powerful word in the English language. From a doctor, it’s the most devastating thing you’ll hear. From a loved one, it marks the starting line of the most harrowing emotional journey one can face. And I pray you’re spared from both scenarios. However, if cancer ever had a shred of positivity to it, here it is: It’s called the cancer corollary. The cancer corollary is a hypothetical syllogism that exposes cerebral bullshit and eradicates it. Used willfully, it kills paper crutches and dartboarded excuses. Anytime your cerebral dogma mouths off and argues you’re too young, too old, too poor, too this, and too that, the cancer corollary breaks the pattern. I apologize for the suggestion, but it works like this: Hypothetically assume you’ve been diagnosed with cancer and your mortality has been redefined from decades to months. Also assume a cancer cure exists. The cure, formulated by one individual named Joe Blow, is just $5,000. And you aim to buy it. Now consider this. Before opening your wallet and giving your cash to Joe Blow, will you consider (or ask about)

The fourth reason why “love” and “passion” shouldn’t be your bread-maker is called the overjustification effect. The overjustification effect is a psychologically studied phenomenon lending credibility to the idea that “do what you love” and “follow your passion” are destructive career advice. Namely, once you get paid extrinsic rewards for something you once did freely due to sheer intrinsic motives, your interest in that activity suffers. According to Wikipedia via Psychology: The Science of Behavior, the overjustification effect occurs…

In other research, the psychological self-determination theory (SDT) is another theory that supports autonomy as well as connectedness as a critical factor in happiness. Studied by researchers Richard Ryan and Edward Deci from Rochester University, SDT posits that best forms of motivation and engagement, including persistence and creativity, come from our experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Specifically, Deci and Ryan postulated that these needs, when satisfied, enhance self-motivation and mental health (well-being), and when thwarted, do the opposite.79 Basically, intrinsic improvement and growth (competence), freedom (autonomy), and family (relatedness) are core constituents of happiness.

The point is they don’t flood the market with advertising because they don’t need to advertise. They possess entrepreneurship’s Holy Grail: a productocracy.

Control Does your solution have any primary dependents for execution? Example: exclusively sold at Walmart, distributed at Facebook, etc. If so, what control risks can be mitigated? Does your solution have secondary dependents? Partners, suppliers, manufacturing, importers, channels? Entry What are the entry barriers for your solution? What key resources, assets, or relationships strengthen, and can strengthen, your entry walls? Does your solution require substantial resource inputs and/or coordination for execution? Is the concept-to-launch two days? Or two months? How will your competitor(s) respond to your solution? And can you sustain their adjustment? Need Have you identified ALL the value attributes within your industry? Is your proposed skew strong enough to adequately firm a unique selling proposition (USP) relevant to your target customer? Can you effectively communicate this value skew to your target customer? How is your solution monetized? What are your primary and secondary revenue models? Time What resources, if any, are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time? What dependencies are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time? What are the future challenges for these requirements? Scale Are there existing mediums, channels, or partners that can reach large numbers of your target market? What is your solution’s scaling economy and their resources—funding, infrastructure, and human capital—required to scale it? Are there any scale challenges in the cost structure and/or supply chain? After your concept survives the CENTS wringer, it’s time to prove its worth.

Another deviant method is creating a sales page that can’t close. The objective here is to track clicks to the order page. If that happens, the buyer is presented with a “Sold Out” notice or some other explanation. While this is effective at proving soft demand, it pushes ethical boundaries and isn’t something I’d try unless approached authentically.

After you identify your brand persona, identify the specific initiatives that would make it happen. Is it a no-time-limit, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee? Is it the ability to talk to a human being without having to press a gazillion buttons? Is it eco-friendly with a portion of profits going to a nonprofit environmental organization? Consistency of brand action must always be congruent with operations, from you to your employees.

TELL A STORY If you want to sell more of anything, give your product or company a story. People love stories because it’s how we make sense of our world. Linking a story to your company or product gives the customer a chance to become part of the narrative. When the story resonates with your customer’s identity, it strengthens your brand.

Economic flux is the methodology behind rule #2: the snap rule. The snap rule requires that paycheck-pot investments must remain highly liquid, or recallable back to cash at the snap of a finger.

The “snap of a finger” usually means a simple sell order at a brokerage firm and within twenty-four hours, sometimes within seconds, you’re out of the investment and safely back to cash.

The snap rule says that if a cash recall takes longer than a finger snap to initiate, liquidity could be an issue. Liquidity issues put your principal at risk in shifting markets.

Each of these entities is large enough where a failure (or a large-scale fraud) in any of them would inject systemic risk into the world banking system. In other words, if Vanguard’s umbrella of shareholder-owned companies fails, I know we’re looking at a worldwide failure in the banking system and, perhaps, an event so large that the world will never be the same.

If, after selling an appreciated asset, it reverts down, I use a 66 percent mean reversion as a potential rebuy flag. Assuming the company’s financials have not changed, the 66 percent criteria is a guideline, not a rule. For instance, in our Southern Company scenario, a fifty-dollar stock sale (a move of seven dollars from forty-three dollars) might be worth rebuying in the forty-five-dollar range (66% of $7.00 is $4.62 [$50 - $45.38]). The 66 percent reversion flag is based on mean reversion, which is the statistical probability that stocks mean revert back to averages as opposed to shooting straight to the stars or down to zero. I dance this little rhythm of buy-sell-rebuy quite often. It sounds like a lot of work when, in reality, it only requires a daily ten-second peek at your paycheck-pot investments.

Once your account is established, start researching paycheck-pot assets. A good starting point are the in-house funds that many firms offer. Vanguard, by far my favorite, has a wide variety of managed distribution funds with extremely low fees. T. Rowe Price and Fidelity also have a large selection. Keep in mind the 1 percent rule, as well as any “redemption fees”—fees charged for shares sold after a short period of time. For example, T. Rowe Price’s Emerging Market Bond (PREMX) has an annual yield of 5.6 percent paying monthly with fees less than 1 percent. It also has a 2 percent redemption fee. This fund is an acceptable paycheck-pot asset,

The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes – and everything between.

Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your face. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing.

Hans’s Horse Sense is just that – watching people, seeing how they’re reacting, and then making your moves accordingly. Even while you’re talking, keep your eyes on your listeners and watch how they’re responding to what you’re saying. Don’t miss a trick. Are they smiling? Are they nodding? Are their palms up? They like what they’re hearing.

Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense.

Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really taking off. She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the sweet spot.
Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests.

Technique 47: Employ empathizers Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like ‘I see what you mean.’ Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like ‘That’s a lovely thing to say.’ Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue. Of course, you pay a price. In order to use the right empathizers, you do need to listen.

LEVEL ONE: CLICHÉS Two strangers talking together primarily toss clichés back and forth. For instance, when chatting about the universally agreed-upon world’s dullest subject, the weather, one stranger might say to the other, ‘Beautiful sunny weather we’ve been having.’ Or, ‘Boy, some rain, huh?’ That’s level one, clichés.

LEVEL THREE: FEELINGS AND PERSONAL QUESTIONS When people become friends, they often express their feelings to each other, even on subjects as dull as the weather. ‘George, I just love these sunny days.’ They also ask each other personal questions: ‘How about you, Betty? Are you a sun person?’

LEVEL FOUR: WE STATEMENTS Now we progress to the highest level of intimacy. This level is richer than facts and creates more rapport than feelings. It’s we and us statements. Friends discussing the weather might say, ‘If we keep having this good weather, it’ll be a great summer.’ Lovers might say, ‘I hope this good weather keeps up for us so we can go swimming on our trip.’

Mind boggling, isn’t it? Sociologists’ research shows: (1) a compliment from a new person is more potent than from someone you already know, (2) your compliment has more credibility when given to an unattractive person or an attractive person whose face you’ve never seen, (3) you are taken more seriously if you preface your comments by some self-effacing remark – but only if your listener perceives you as higher on the totem pole.

Technique 51: Grapevine glory A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing, bootlicking, egg-sucking, back-scratching sycophant trying to win brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness.

Technique 67: Your ten-second audition While dialling, clear your throat. If an answering machine picks up, pretend the beep is a big Broadway producer saying ‘Nexxxt.’ Now you’re on. This is Your Ten-Second Audition to prove you are worthy of a quick callback.

Technique 68: The ho-hum caper Instead of using your party’s name, casually let the pronoun he or she roll off your tongue. Forget ‘Uh, may I speak to Ms Bigshot please?’ Just announce, ‘Hi, Bob Smith here, is she in?’ Tossing the familiar she off your tongue signals to the secretary that you and her boss are old buddies.

Technique 69: ‘I hear your other line’ When you hear a phone in the background, stop speaking – in midsentence if necessary – and say ‘I hear your other line’ (or your dog barking, your baby crying, your spouse calling you). Ask whether she has to attend to it. Whether she does or not, she’ll know you’re a Top Communicator for asking.

Technique 70: Instant replay Record all your business conversations and listen to them again. The second or third time, you pick up on significant subtleties you missed the first time. It’s like football fans who often don’t know if there was a fumble until they see it all over again in Instant Replay.

Technique 71: Munching or mingling Politicians want to be eyeball-to-eyeball and belly-to-belly with their constituents. Like any Big Winner well versed in the science of proxemics and spatial relationships, they know any object except their belt buckles has the effect of a brick wall between two people. Therefore they never hold food or drink at a party.

Technique 72: Rubberneck the room When you arrive at the gathering, stop dramatically in the doorway. Then s-l-o-w-l-y survey the situation. Let your eyes travel back and forth like a SWAT team ready in a heartbeat to wipe out anything that moves.

Technique 73: Be the chooser, not the choosee The lifelong friend, the love of your life, or the business contact who will transform your future may not be at the party. However, someday, somewhere, he or she will be. Make every party a rehearsal for the big event. Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you. You make it happen by exploring every face in the room. No more ‘ships passing in the night.’ Capture whatever or whomever you want in your life.

Technique 74: Come-hither hands Be a human magnet, not a human repellant. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open position – especially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the ‘come hither’ position. They shy away from knuckles in the ‘get lost or I’ll punch you’ position. Use your wrists and palms to say ‘I have nothing to hide,’ ‘I accept you and what you’re saying,’ or ‘I find you sexy.’

Technique 75: Tracking Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your Conversation Partners’ lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a powerful sense of intimacy. When you envoke the last major or minor event in anyone’s life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom.

Technique 76: The business card dossier Right after you’ve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favourite restaurant, sport, film, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honour; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favourite restaurant, film, movie, drink, hometown, high school prize. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke. They may not jump up and down asking, ‘How did you remember that?’ Nevertheless, they will remember you. No matter how important the VIP, he or she senses a special kinship with the person who refers to other than their usual well-known accomplishments. Politicians are constantly selling themselves. (If you’ve ever wondered why America is called ‘The Land of Promise,’ just keep your ears open in election

If your listener turns away while you’re talking, don’t concentrate on how rude the person is. Like a sales pro, ask yourself, ‘How can I change the subject to turn this person on?’ If their whole body starts to turn away, use the time-honoured personal question ploy. Ask about their favourite topic.

Technique 77: Eyeball selling The human body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station that transmits ‘You thrill me.’ ‘You bore me.’ ‘I love that aspect of your product.’ ‘That one puts my feet to sleep.’ Set the hidden cameras behind your eyeballs to pick up on all your customers’ and friends’ signals. Then plan your pitch and your pace accordingly

Technique 78: See no bloopers, hear no bloopers Cool Communicators allow their friends, associates, acquaintances, and loved ones the pleasurable myth of being above commonplace bloopers and embarrassing biological functions. They simply don’t notice their comrades’ minor spills, slips, fumbles, and faux pas. They obviously ignore raspberries and all other signs of human frailty in their fellow mortals. Big Winners never gape at another’s gaffes.

Technique 79: Lend a helping tongue Whenever someone’s story is aborted, let the interruption play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, ‘Now please get back to your story.’ Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, ‘So what happened after the … (and fill in the last few words.)’

Technique 82: Tit for (wait … wait) tat When people do you favours and it’s obvious ‘they owe you one,’ wait a suitable amount of time before asking them to ‘pay.’ Let them enjoy the fact (or fiction) that you did it out of friendship. Don’t call in your tit for their tat too swiftly.

Technique 83: Parties are for pratter There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big Players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher settings.

Technique 84: Dinner’s for dining The most guarded safe haven respected by Big Winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know it’s OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business. This convention probably arose out of a prudent agreement not to inflict indigestion on each other. Tough negotiating is unpalatable and can ruin an otherwise perfectly mouthwatering veal chop. Incidentally, the same rule applies in the social jungle. If one partner in a friendship or a love relationship has some heavy relationship issues to discuss, save them for after dessert. Even if you don’t solve the problem, you want to enjoy the delicious chocolate soufflé.

For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now.
