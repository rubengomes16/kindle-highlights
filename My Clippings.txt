La guerra es el arte del engaño.9 Por lo tanto, si eres capaz, finge incapacidad. Si estás preparado, finge no estarlo. Si estás cerca, finge estar lejos. Si estás lejos, finge estar cerca. Tienta al enemigo con cebos, aparenta desorden y golpéalo. Si el enemigo es consistente, prepárate. Si es fuerte, evítalo. Si es iracundo, provócalo. Si es orgulloso, muestra humildad. Si está descansado, fatígalo. Si está unido, divídelo. Atácalo cuando no lo espere. Aparece de manera imprevista.10 Estas estratagemas aseguran la victoria, pero no pueden divulgarse.

Baudrillard señala la peculiaridad arquitectónica de las Torres Gemelas, que ya en 1993 fueron el objetivo de atentados terroristas islámicos. Mientras que los rascacielos del Rockefeller Center reflejan la ciudad y el cielo sobre sus fachadas de vidrio y acero, las Torres Gemelas no implicaban ninguna referencia externa, ninguna relación con lo otro. Los dos edificios gemelos, iguales entre sí y que se reflejan mutuamente, constituyen un sistema cerrado en sí mismo. Imponen lo igual, excluyendo por completo lo distinto. El atentado terrorista abrió brechas en este sistema global de lo igual.

You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.

the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It’s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them—or the world, which is their primary concern? And if they haven’t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace.

When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger.

In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?

Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer. Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present—and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can’t hold out against that … well, then, heap shame upon it.
